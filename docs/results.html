                                <p>The analysis of average power spectral density (PSD) confirmed the established phenomenon of oscillatory slowing in patients who later converted to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compared to the non-converter (NOCONV) group, the CONV group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in relative power within the beta frequency band. This decrease was observed in two key regions of interest (ROIs): the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; 17-30 Hz) and the precuneus (PC; 11-27 Hz). Conversely, the CONV group exhibited a significant increase in relative power in lower frequency bands (theta/low-alpha) in both the ACC (5-7 Hz) and PC (4-8 Hz). These spectral differences are visually represented in

                                <p>The study established that the seemingly continuous average power in the alpha and beta bands, as seen in standard PSD plots, originates from the temporal summation of transient, high-power oscillatory "events" in the unaveraged neural signal. <strong class="trigger" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-expanded="false">Figure 3

                                <p>To quantify how these transient events contribute to the average power, regression analyses were performed. For the beta band ([12-30] Hz), there was a strong, significant positive correlation between averaged beta power and several event features: event number (rate; β = .28, p = .0088), event duration (β = .45, p < .0001), and event peak power (β = .41, p = .0001). A significant negative correlation was found with event frequency span (β = -.29, p = .0075). In contrast, for the alpha band ([5-10] Hz), only event frequency span showed a significant (but weaker) correlation with averaged alpha power after multiple comparison correction (β = -.25, p = .025).

A strong trend toward shorter beta event duration in the PC was also observed (p = .051). In the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), beta event duration was significantly shorter in the CONV group (p = .002). The effect sizes (Cohen's d) for these differences were in the medium range (d > 0.4). No significant group differences were found for any alpha event features.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Prediction of AD Conversion:</strong> Logistic regression models revealed that diminished beta event features were associated with a higher probability of converting from MCI to AD within 2.5 years. Specifically:

                                <p><strong>In summary,</strong> the results demonstrate that the well-documented "slowing" of the neural oscillatory profile in prodromal AD is mechanistically linked to a reduction in the expression of transient, high-power beta band events (specifically, their rate, power, and duration) within hub regions of the default mode network. These specific beta event deficits not only differentiate future AD converters but also predict both a higher likelihood of clinical conversion and the degree of concurrent cognitive decline.</p>
